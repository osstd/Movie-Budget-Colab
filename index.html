        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Do higher film budgets lead to more box office revenue? Let's find out
          if there's a relationship using the movie budgets and financial
          performance data that have been scraped from the-numbers.com on
          <u>May 1st, 2018</u>.

        <h2>Data Manipulation</h2>
        <p>
          To begin, we will read in the dataset from a .csv file into a Pandas
          dataframe. We will then inspect the first and last few rows of the
          data to get a sense of its structure and content. Next, we will
          examine the dimensions of the dataframe, including the number of rows
          and columns, and count the number of entries in each column.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Read in the dataset from a .csv file</li>
          <li>Inspect the first and last few rows of the data</li>
          <li>Examine the dimensions of the dataframe</li>
          <li>Count the number of entries in each column</li>
          <li>Remove any NaN values present</li>
          <li>Check and eliminate any duplicate rows</li>
          <li>
            Convert the `USD_Production_Budget`, `USD_Worldwide_Gross`, and
            `USD_Domestic_Gross` columns to a numeric format by removing `$`
            signs and `,`.
          </li>
          <li>Change the `Release_Date` column to a Pandas Datetime type.</li>
          <li>
            Use <code>.describe()</code> to get descriptive statistics of the
            dataset

          This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between movie release
          year and production budget, with each data point representing a film.
          The color and size of each point are mapped to the movie's gross
          revenue, with larger and lighter in color points indicating higher
          grossing films, providing a visual representation of the correlation
          between budget and success.

        <h2>Seaborn Regression Plots Old Films</h2>
        <p>
          Create a DataFrame for old films that includes all the films released
          up to 1969, and create another DataFrame called new films that
          includes all the films released from 1970 onwards. These two
          DataFrames will help in analyzing the films before and after 1970
          separately.

        <p>
          This following plot shows the relationship between worldwide gross and
          production budget for films released up to 1969 (old films). The plot
          reveals a positive correlation between the two variables, indicating
          that films with higher production budgets tend to have higher
          worldwide grosses. Notably, the most expensive film produced during
          this period was Cleopatra, with a budget of 42 million USD.

        <h2>New Films</h2>
        <p>
          This plot shows the relationship between worldwide gross and
          production budget for films released from 1970 onwards (new films).
          The data points for new films demonstrate a stronger linear
          correlation compared to old films, indicating a more predictable
          relationship between budget and success. Notably, Avatar (released in
          2009) holds the record for the highest worldwide gross, approximately
          2.8 billion USD, as of May 2018. According to the regression, a film
          with a production cost of 100 million USD would be expected to gross
          around 300 million USD, compared to approximately 190 million USD for
          old films.
